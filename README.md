The system provides an initial test that is called a mandatory test to all students of various departments during their beginner stage. Based upon the outcome, the system will generate  an individual student report, where each and every student data will be analyzed and their benchmarks will be highlighted. Furthermore, test levels will be generated based upon their previous performance and questions will be randomly distributed for each student based upon their performance. The student can attempt the test multiple times to improve his/ her placement skills. The attempts made by the students and related scores will be updated to the respective faculty members and to the students.
